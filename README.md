# BitArray

This is my implementation of a packed array of bits in Java.

DO NOT USE IT FOR REAL PROJECTS! Use Java's built-in `BitSet` class instead. This was purely an educational thing for me.

The repo also includes a small example program using this class which implements the famous "Sieve of Erastophenes" algorithm.
